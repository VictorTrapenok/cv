          At Nanoheal, as Principal Engineer, my focus has been on multi-tenant SaaS cloud projects, harnessing Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure to
          streamline deployments and enhance product demonstrations. The solutions developed under my leadership have significantly reduced deployment times,
          saving countless hours for our team and clients. The ability to deploy services rapidly for testing has not only accelerated development cycles but
          also fortified our product's reliability and scalability. Strong skils DevOps + Full-stack + cloud engineering allows me to get better result from
          contributing to code and infrustructure in the same time. Open to relocation to USA / Europe
